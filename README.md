Hangman
=======

How to Play
-----------

Run "$ ruby bin/hangman.rb" from the command line.  
You will be prompted to enter a letter. If you enter any other valid string starting with a letter other than "load" and "save" it will take the first letter put in.  You can save your game by typing "save" and specifying a file name.  You can load a previously saved game by typing "load" and specifying a file name.

You will guess letters until you have six failed attempts.  At that point, you will be "hanged".
